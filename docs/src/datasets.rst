DecryptM
--------

**Alias:** decryptm

**Description:** Drug perturbation proteomics and phosphoproteomics data

**Publication Link:** `DecryptM Dataset <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade3925>`_

**Detailed Description:** This dataset contains the profiling of 31 cancer drugs in 13 human cancer cell line models, resulting in 1.8 million dose-response curves. The data includes 47,502 regulated phosphopeptides, 7316 ubiquitinylated peptides, and 546 regulated acetylated peptides.

PANACEA
-------

**Alias:** panacea

**Description:** Pancancer Analysis of Chemical Entity Activity RNA-Seq data

**Publication Link:** `Panacea Dataset <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100492>`_

**Detailed Description:** PANACEA contains dose-response and perturbational profiles for 32 kinase inhibitors in 11 cancer cell lines, in addition to a DMSO control. Originally, this resource served as the basis for a DREAM Challenge assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of computational algorithms for de novo drug polypharmacology predictions.

CPTAC
-----

**Alias:** CPTAC

**Description:** Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium data

**Publication Link:** `CPTAC Dataset <https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0219>`_

**Detailed Description:** This dataset contains data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. It includes various cancer types and proteomic data.

NCI60
-----

**Alias:** NCI60

**Description:** NCI-60 cell line data

**Publication Link:** `NCI60 Dataset <https://doi.org/10.1038/nrc1951>`_

**Detailed Description:** This dataset contains data from the NCI-60 cell line panel. It includes three files: TF activities from transcriptomics data, metabolite abundances, and gene reads.
