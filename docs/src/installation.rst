``NetworkCommons`` requires Python version >= 3.10 to run.


-------------------

Currently, it can be installed from GitHub via Poetry. Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. More information `here <https://python-poetry.org>`_.

.. code-block:: console

   poetry install git+https://github.com/saezlab/networkcommons
